Repository storing my DU Basketball WebScraper.

Thanks for checking out my repo! 

In order to run this program, you must have Selenium and GeckoDriver installed. This can be easily completed
through https://brew.sh. You will also need credentials to the Synergy Sports Tech Website, I would include 
mine, but my credentials were only available for the development of this program.

If you do run end up running this program, be aware that 200+ CSV files will be exported to the folder containing the program.
